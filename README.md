# project- Vehicles Number Plate Detection and Recognition
Welcome to our project

We took images of the front or back side of the vehicles in which the numberplate is visible from a finite distance. By running a deep learning model
using opencv and tensorflow , the system detects the rectangular shaped numberplate and then extracts the number from the plate and that is shown in a table 
in the user interface.

## üõ† How to run our project?
> - Install python on your computer
> - Clone this project in a new folder
> - Run the app.py file
